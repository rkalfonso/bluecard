If there is a god, he's not only a wizard of leaving clues behind. More than anything, he's a master of concealmetn. And the world is not something that gives itself away. The heavens still keeps their secrets. There is a little gossip amongst the stars. But no one has forgotten the Big Bang yet. Since then, silence has reignes supreme, and everything there is moving away. One can still come across a moon, or a comet. Just don't expecr friendly greetings. No visiting cards are printed in space.

I think if your clients want to sit on my shoulders and call themselves tall they have the rights to give it a try, but there's no requirement that I enjoy sitting here listening to people lie. You have a part of my attention--you have a minimum amount. The rest of my attention is back at the offices of Facebook where my colleagues and I are doing things that no one in this room, including and especially your clients are intellectually or creatively capable of doing. Did I adequately answer your condescending question?
