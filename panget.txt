If there is a god, he's not only a wizard of leaving clues behind. More than anything, he's a master of concealmetn. And the world is not something that gives itself away. The heavens still keeps their secrets. There is a little gossip amongst the stars. But no one has forgotten the Big Bang yet. Since then, silence has reignes supreme, and everything there is moving away. One can still come across a moon, or a comet. Just don't expecr friendly greetings. No visiting cards are printed in space.
